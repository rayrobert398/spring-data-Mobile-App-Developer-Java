= Introduction to `DatabaseClient`

Spring Data R2DBC includes a reactive, non-blocking `DatabaseClient` for database interaction. The client has a functional, fluent API with reactive types for declarative composition.
`DatabaseClient` encapsulates resource handling such as opening and closing connections so your application code can make use of executing SQL queries or calling higher-level functionality such as inserting or selecting data.

NOTE: `DatabaseClient` is a young application component providing a minimal set of convenience methods that is likely to be extended through time.

NOTE: Once configured, `DatabaseClient` is thread-safe and can be reused across multiple instances.

Another central feature of `DatabaseClient` is translation of exceptions thrown by R2DBC drivers into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy. See "`<<r2dbc.exception>>`" for more information.

The next section contains an example of how to work with the `DatabaseClient` in the context of the Spring container.

== Creating `DatabaseClient`

The simplest way to create a `DatabaseClient` is through a static factory method:

[source,java]
----
DatabaseClient.create(ConnectionFactory connectionFactory)
----

The above method creates a `DatabaseClient` with default settings.

You can also use `DatabaseClient.builder()` with further options to customize the client:

* `exceptionTranslator`: Supply a specific `R2dbcExceptionTranslator` to customize how R2DBC exceptions are translated into Spring's portable Data Access Exception hierarchy.  See "`<<r2dbc.exception>>`" for more information.
* `dataAccessStrategy`: Strategy how SQL queries are generated and how objects are mapped.

Once built, a `DatabaseClient` instance is immutable. However, you can clone it and build a modified copy without affecting the original instance, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
DatabaseClient client1 = DatabaseClient.builder()
        .exceptionTranslator(exceptionTranslatorA).build();

DatabaseClient client2 = client1.mutate()
        .exceptionTranslator(exceptionTranslatorB).build();
----

== Controlling Database Connections

Spring Data R2DBC obtains a connection to the database through a `ConnectionFactory`.
A `ConnectionFactory` is part of the R2DBC specification and is a generalized connection factory.
It lets a container or a framework hide connection pooling and transaction management issues from the application code.

When you use Spring Data R2DBC, you can create a `ConnectionFactory` using your R2DBC driver.
`ConnectionFactory` implementations can either return the same connection, different connections or provide connection pooling.
`DatabaseClient` uses `ConnectionFactory` to create and release connections per operation without affinity to a particular connection across multiple operations.

= Exception Translation

The Spring framework provides exception translation for a wide variety of database and mapping technologies.
The Spring support for R2DBC extends this feature by providing implementations of the `R2dbcExceptionTranslator` interface.

`R2dbcExceptionTranslator` is an interface to be implemented by classes that can translate between `R2dbcException` and Spring’s own `org.springframework.dao.DataAccessException`, which is agnostic in regard to data access strategy.
Implementations can be generic (for example, using SQLState codes) or proprietary (for example, using Postgres error codes) for greater precision.

`R2dbcExceptionSubclassTranslator` is the implementation of `R2dbcExceptionTranslator` that is used by default.
It considers R2DBC's categorized exception hierarchy to translate these into Spring's consistent exception hierarchy.
`R2dbcExceptionSubclassTranslator` uses `SqlStateR2dbcExceptionTranslator` as fallback if it is not able to translate an exception.

`SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator` uses specific vendor codes using Spring JDBC's `SQLErrorCodes`.
It is more precise than the SQLState implementation.
The error code translations are based on codes held in a JavaBean type class called `SQLErrorCodes`.
This class is created and populated by an `SQLErrorCodesFactory`, which (as the name suggests) is a factory for creating SQLErrorCodes based on the contents of a configuration file named `sql-error-codes.xml` from Spring's Data Access module.
This file is populated with vendor codes and based on the `ConnectionFactoryName` taken from `ConnectionFactoryMetadata`.
The codes for the actual database you are using are used.

The `SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator` applies matching rules in the following sequence:

1. Any custom translation implemented by a subclass. Normally, the provided concrete `SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator` is used, so this rule does not apply. It applies only if you have actually provided a subclass implementation.
2. Any custom implementation of the `SQLExceptionTranslator` interface that is provided as the `customSqlExceptionTranslator` property of the `SQLErrorCodes` class.
3. Error code matching is applied.
4. Use a fallback translator.

NOTE: The `SQLErrorCodesFactory` is used by default to define Error codes and custom exception translations. They are looked up in a file named `sql-error-codes.xml` from the classpath, and the matching `SQLErrorCodes` instance is located based on the database name from the database metadata of the database in use. `SQLErrorCodesFactory` requires Spring JDBC.

You can extend `SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator`, as the following example shows:

[source,java]
----
public class CustomSqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator extends SqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator {

    protected DataAccessException customTranslate(String task, String sql, R2dbcException r2dbcex) {
        if (sqlex.getErrorCode() == -12345) {
            return new DeadlockLoserDataAccessException(task, r2dbcex);
        }
        return null;
    }
}
----

In the preceding example, the specific error code (`-12345`) is translated, while other errors are left to be translated by the default translator implementation.
To use this custom translator, you must configure `DatabaseClient` through the builder method `exceptionTranslator`, and you must use this `DatabaseClient` for all of the data access processing where this translator is needed.
The following example shows how you can use this custom translator:

[source,java]
----
ConnectionFactory connectionFactory = …;

CustomSqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator exceptionTranslator = new CustomSqlErrorCodeR2dbcExceptionTranslator();

DatabaseClient client = DatabaseClient.builder()
                            .connectionFactory(connectionFactory)
                            .exceptionTranslator(exceptionTranslator)
                            .build();
----
